Solvers for the Traveling Salesman Problem, implemented in JavaScript.

There are three solvers available:
- Simulated Annealing
- Evolutionary
- Greedy

If you want to improve the solution's quality, there's also a Lin-Kernighan Optimizer for you convenience.

Please note that my implementation of the Greedy-Algorithm depends on a triangle-mesh, like that provided by https://github.com/ironwallaby/delaunay.
